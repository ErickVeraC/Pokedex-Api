## API Integration

The application retrieves data from a Pokemon API to display information about different Pokemon. It uses the `fetch` function to make HTTP requests and retrieve the necessary data. The fetched data is then used to populate the Pokedex with relevant information.

By making these requests, the application is able to provide comprehensive information about each Pokemon.
